 * Sum of matrix in which each element is absolute difference of its row and column numbers
 * Difficulty Level : Medium
 * Last Updated : 08 Jan, 2019
 * Given a positive integer n. Consider a matrix of n rows and n columns, in which each element contain absolute difference of its row number and numbers. The task is to calculate sum of each element of the matrix.
 *
 * Examples :
 *
 * Input : n = 2
 * Output : 2
 * Matrix formed with n = 2 with given constraint:
 * 0 1
 * 1 0
 * Sum of matrix = 2.
 *
 * Input : n = 3
 * Output : 8
 * Matrix formed with n = 3 with given constraint:
 * 0 1 2
 * 1 0 1
 * 2 1 0
 * Sum of matrix = 8.
 * Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
 * Method 1 (Brute Force):
 * Simply construct a matrix of n rows and n columns and initialize each cell with absolute difference of its corresponding row number and column number.
 * Now, find the sum of each cell.
