 *
 * If most of the elements in the matrix are zero then the matrix is called a sparse matrix.
 * It is wasteful to store the zero elements in the matrix since they do not affect the results of our computation. This is why we implement these matrices in more efficient representations than the standard 2D Array.
 * Using more efficient representations we can cut down space and time complexities of operations significantly.
