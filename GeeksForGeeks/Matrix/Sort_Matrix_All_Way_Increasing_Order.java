 * Sort a Matrix in all way increasing order
 * Difficulty Level : Basic
 * Last Updated : 03 Mar, 2017
 * Given a square matrix of order N*N having distinct elements, the task is to sort given matrix in such a way that its rows, columns and both diagonals (diagonal and anti-diagonal) are in increasing order.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input : arr[3][3] = {1, 4, 2,
 *                      3, 5, 6,
 *                      9, 7, 8}
 * Output :{1, 2, 3,
 *          4, 5, 6,
 *          7, 8, 9}
 *
 * Input : arr[2][2] = {0, 4,
 *                      5, 2}
 * Output :{0, 2,
 *          4, 5}
