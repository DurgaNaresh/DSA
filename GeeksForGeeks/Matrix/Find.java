 * Given a Boolean Matrix, find k such that all elements in k’th row are 0 and k’th column are 1.
 * Difficulty Level : Hard
 * Last Updated : 24 Dec, 2018
 * Given a square boolean matrix mat[n][n], find k such that all elements in k’th row are 0 and all elements in k’th column are 1. The value of mat[k][k] can be anything (either 0 or 1). If no such k exists, return -1.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input: bool mat[n][n] = { {1, 0, 0, 0},
 *                           {1, 1, 1, 0},
 *                           {1, 1, 0, 0},
 *                           {1, 1, 1, 0},
 *                         };
 * Output: 0
 * All elements in 0'th row are 0 and all elements in
 * 0'th column are 1.  mat[0][0] is 1 (can be any value)
 *
 *
 * Input: bool mat[n][n] = {{0, 1, 1, 0, 1},
 *                          {0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
 *                          {1, 1, 1, 0, 0},
 *                          {1, 1, 1, 1, 0},
 *                          {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}};
 * Output: 1
 * All elements in 1'st row are 0 and all elements in
 * 1'st column are 1.  mat[1][1] is 0 (can be any value)
 *
 *
 * Input: bool mat[n][n] = {{0, 1, 1, 0, 1},
 *                          {0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
 *                          {1, 1, 1, 0, 0},
 *                          {1, 0, 1, 1, 0},
 *                          {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}};
 * Output: -1
 * There is no k such that k'th row elements are 0 and
 * k'th column elements are 1.
 * Expected time complexity is O(n)
 *
 * We strongly recommend you to minimize your browser and try this yourself first.
 *
 * A Simple Solution is check all rows one by one. If we find a row ‘i’ such that all elements of this row are 0 except mat[i][i] which may be either 0 or 1, then we check all values in column ‘i’. If all values are 1 in the column, then we return i. Time complexity of this solution is O(n2).
 *
 * An Efficient Solution can solve this problem in O(n) time. The solution is based on below facts.
 * 1) There can be at most one k that can be qualified to be an answer (Why? Note that if k’th row has all 0’s probably except mat[k][k], then no column can have all 1′)s.
 * 2) If we traverse the given matrix from a corner (preferably from top right and bottom left), we can quickly discard complete row or complete column based on below rules.
 * ….a) If mat[i][j] is 0 and i != j, then column j cannot be the solution.
 * ….b) If mat[i][j] is 1 and i != j, then row i cannot be the solution.
 *
 * Below is complete algorithm based on above observations.
 *
 * 1) Start from top right corner, i.e., i = 0, j = n-1.
 *    Initialize result as -1.
 *
 * 2) Do following until we find the result or reach outside the matrix.
 *
 * ......a) If mat[i][j] is 0, then check all elements on left of j in current row.
 * .........If all elements on left of j are also 0, then set result as i. Note
 * .........that i may not be result, but if there is a result, then it must be i
 * .........(Why? we reach mat[i][j] after discarding all rows above it and all
 * .........columns on right of it)
 *
 * .........If all left side elements of i'th row are not 0, them this row cannot
 * .........be a solution, increment i.
 *
 * ......b) If mat[i][j] is 1, then check all elements below i in current column.
 * .........If all elements below i are 1, then set result as j. Note that j may
 * ......... not be result, but if there is a result, then it must be j
 *
 * .........If all elements of j'th column are not 1, them this column cannot be a
 * .........solution decrement j.
 *
 * 3) If result is -1, return it.
 *
 * 4) Else check validity of result by checking all row and column
 *           elements of result
