 * Ways of filling matrix such that product of all rows and all columns are equal to unity
 *
 * We are given three values n, m and k where n is number of rows in matrix,
 * m is number of columns in the matrix and k is the number that can have only two values -1 and 1.
 * Our aim is to find the number of ways of filling the matrix of  n \times m such that the product of all the elements in each row and each column is equal to k.
 * Since the number of ways can be large we will output ans \mod{1000000007}
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input : n = 2, m = 4, k = -1
 * Output : 8
 * Following configurations satisfy the conditions:-
 * Different configirations
 * different configurations
 *
 * Input  : n = 2, m = 1, k = -1
 * Output : The number of filling the matrix
 *          are 0
 * Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
 * From the above conditions, it is clear that the only elements that can be entered in the matrix are 1 and -1. Now we can easily deduce some of the corner cases
 *
 * If k = -1, then the sum of number of rows and columns cannot be odd because -1 will be present odd
 * number of times in each row and column therefore if the sum is odd then answer is 0.
 * If n = 1 or m = 1 then there is only one way of filling the matrix therefore answer is 1.
 * If none of the above cases are applicable then we fill the first n-1 rows and the first m-1 columns with 1 and -1. Then the remaining numbers can be uniquely identified since the product of each row an each column is already known therefore the answer is 2 ^ {(n-1) \times (m-1)}.
