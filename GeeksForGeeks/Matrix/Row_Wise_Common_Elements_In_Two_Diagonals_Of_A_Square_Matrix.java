 *
 * Row-wise common elements in two diagonals of a square matrix
 * Difficulty Level : Easy
 * Last Updated : 14 Jun, 2018
 * Given a square matrix, find out count of numbers that are same in same row and same in both primary and secondary diagonals.
 *
 * Examples :
 *
 * Input : 1 2 1
 *         4 5 2
 *         0 5 1
 * Output : 2
 * Primary diagonal is 1 5 1
 * Secondary diagonal is 1 5 0
 * Two elements (1 and 5) match
 * in two diagonals and same.
 *
 * Input : 1 0 0
 *         0 1 0
 *         0 0 1
 * Output : 1
 * Primary diagonal is 1 1 1
 * Secondary diagonal is 0 1 0
 * Only one element is same.
