 * Maximum size rectangle binary sub-matrix with all 1s
 * Difficulty Level : Hard
 * Last Updated : 06 Nov, 2020
 * Given a binary matrix, find the maximum size rectangle binary-sub-matrix with all 1’s.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input:
 * 0 1 1 0
 * 1 1 1 1
 * 1 1 1 1
 * 1 1 0 0
 * Output :
 * 1 1 1 1
 * 1 1 1 1
 * Explanation :
 * The largest rectangle with only 1's is from
 * (1, 0) to (2, 3) which is
 * 1 1 1 1
 * 1 1 1 1
 *
 * Input:
 * 0 1 1
 * 1 1 1
 * 0 1 1
 * Output:
 * 1 1
 * 1 1
 * 1 1
 * Explanation :
 * The largest rectangle with only 1's is from
 * (0, 1) to (2, 2) which is
 * 1 1
 * 1 1
 * 1 1
 *
 * There is already an algorithm discussed a dynamic programming based solution for finding largest square with 1s.
 *
 * Approach: In this post an interesting method is discussed that uses largest rectangle under histogram as a subroutine.
 * If the height of bars of the histogram is given then the largest area of the histogram can be found. This way in each row, the largest area of bars of the histogram can be found. To get the largest rectangle full of 1’s, update the next row with the previous row and find the largest area under the histogram, i.e. consider each 1’s as filled squares and 0’s with an empty square and consider each row as the base.
 *
 * Illustration:
 *
 * Input :
 * 0 1 1 0
 * 1 1 1 1
 * 1 1 1 1
 * 1 1 0 0
 * Step 1:
 * 0 1 1 0  maximum area  = 2
 * Step 2:
 * row 1  1 2 2 1  area = 4, maximum area becomes 4
 * row 2  2 3 3 2  area = 8, maximum area becomes 8
 * row 3  3 4 0 0  area = 6, maximum area remains 8
